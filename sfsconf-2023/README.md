## REDFISH OS & CO. - PROJECT DOCUMENTS

This folder contains some documents in PDF that I have written for the
Linux User Group Bolzano after the SFSCON 2023 in order to create the informal
organisation useful to support its development and as easily deal with the IT
support to developers.

For information about the project, read the business presentation on the dir:

* [RedFishOS-presentation-A4.pdf](../RedFishOS-presentation-A4.pdf)

Note that the first page contains a less than 200 words executive presentation.

### SUMMARY

 I have published some other documentation about this project that you
can retrieve from this link

* =-> http://lnkd.in/d4mWHNZw

and following the links next-post and previous-post. However, for
your convenience I am adding all the PDF documents in this e-mail

 Please notice that some of them have been written in Italian because
the original audience was Italian speaking (LUG Bolzano). As usual,
for a preventive evaluation, the translation service by Google will
allow you to read those documents in your own language.

 Moreover, some of those documents are specifically tailored for a
non-profit organization like LUG Bozen in order to let the people
learn by doing and earning some know-how useful to be hired once the
project would have reached the maturity to be supported by
consultancy.

 This is because a security privacy oriented system - any kind of
system - should be as much as possible open-source in order to be
independently inspected. Even if many people are not capable of such
high-skilled activity, it still remains a fundamental paradigm. Hence,
the revenues are coming more from consultancy rather than selling a
product or a software.

 Yes, "for the people" also under this point of view.

 Therefore, this documentation should be rewritten to fit with a
different organisation. At least, in some parts. Which is the main
reason because I left the document in Italian.
